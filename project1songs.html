  <h2>Adios</h2>
    <h4>Everglow</h4>
	  <p>This K-Pop group released their song named "Adios" in 2019. Its music video exemplifies the common K-Pop concept, "girl crush," with the choreography as its main focus. Though its genre is debated upon, it's a powerful EDM song in a style common among K-Pop groups. Its lyrics harshly tell someone to, essentially, get lost.</p>
	<h4>Hoody, Gray</h4>
	  <p>This KR&B song was also released in 2019. The music video takes place in a convenience store and includes a fight scene. This song is a staple KR&B song that any fan of the genre should know. Its lyrics are about escaping the restrictions of everyday life and feeling free and happy.</p>
  <h2>Airplane Mode</h2>
    <h4>Fromis_9</h4>
	  <p>This K-Pop group released their song named "Airplane Mode" in 2021 as a side track. It's a very fun K-Pop dance song with a nice piano line, solid beat drop, and catchy chorus. It's fun, motivational, and relaxing to listen to all at once. Its lyrics are about the excitement of traveling the world with someone you love. Some of the lyrics suggest that the world travel is metaphorical and actually represents surfing the internet.</p>
	<h4>Limbo</h4>
	  <p>This is a dreamy pop song that gained popularity through a YouTube upload from 2017, though its official release date is in 2018. Its lyrics describe a girl's feelings in a complicated relationship, and it seems that a lot of the complication is coming from the relationship being a long-distance one.</p>
  <h2>Colors</h2>
    <h4>Halsey</h4>
	  <p>This electropop song was released in 2015 as part of one of the artist's most popular albums to date, "Badlands". This song and album played a huge part in a generation's pre-teen and teen years. The lyrics of this song are about a relationship. Despite its name being in plural, the song only focuses on the single color of blue.</p>
	<h4>Loona</h4>
	  <p>This K-Pop girl group song was released in 2019 as a side track. It has no official music video, but it does have choreography. This song is considered a fan-favorite. Its genre is electropop as well as alternative R&B. Its lyrics are about falling in love. Unlike its aforementioned name twin, it does include multiple colors as subjects of its lyrics.</p>
  <h2>Lie</h2>
    <h4>EXID</h4>
	  <p>This K-Pop girl group released their song, stylized as "L.I.E," in 2016. It is a dance K-Pop song. Its music video, like many other K-Pop music videos at the time, is brightly-colored with random symbolic scenes and a vague storyline. The lyrics berate a male love interest for talking to too many girls and being sort of a player.</p>
	<h4>Mad Clown, Lee Hae Ri</h4>
	  <p>This Korean rap song was released in 2017. Its sound can be described as chill, melancholic, and sad. Sandwiched between the rap verses is a ballad refrain. The song's music video depicts some of the good and bad moments of a couple's relationship with gorgeous cinematography and scenery. The lyrics are about a relationship fading and falling apart and the feelings of loss and confliction that come with it.</p>
